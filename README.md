# Hybrid-Perovskite
Hybrid formate perovskites obtained after full ionic and supercell relaxations from initial experimental structure. Both cif and POSCAR files available.

Relaxations used PBE+D3 with PAW pseudopotentials through VASP.

Additionally, OUTCAR files for polarization calculations (where applicable) and piezoelectric, elastic, and dielectric constant calculations are provided.
