# Hybrid-Perovskite
Hybrid formate perovskites obtained after full ionic and supercell relaxations from initial experimental structure. Both cif and POSCAR files available.

Relaxations used PBE+D3 with PAW pseudopotentials through VASP.

Additionally, OUTCAR files for polarization calculations (where applicable) and piezoelectric, elastic, and dielectric constant calculations are provided. 

Experimental structures and corresponding references are also included

Polarization reversal path are also included for polar compounds
